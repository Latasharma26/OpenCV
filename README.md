## Introduction
This repository contains code snippets and exercises that I have created and used while learning OpenCV. The focus of this repository is to explore the various functionalities that OpenCV offers, including face detection, image manipulation, color spaces, and more.

## Installation
To get started with the scripts, you'll need Python 3.x installed along with OpenCV and NumPy libraries. Install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

Ensure your environment is set up to support image and video file handling.

## Topics Covered
This repository covers the following OpenCV concepts and functionalities:

- Basic Image Manipulation (resizing, rescaling, transformations)
- Face, Eye, and Smile Detection using Haar Cascades
- Image Filtering (blurring, thresholding)
- Color Spaces (conversions between BGR, RGB, HSV, etc.)
- Bitwise Operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
- Contour Detection (finding shapes, edges)
- Gradients and Edge Detection (Sobel, Laplacian)
- Histogram Equalization (improving image contrast)
- Masking and ROI (Region of Interest)

## File Descriptions
Hereâ€™s a list of the scripts and their functionalities:

- **Real_time_Face_Detection.py**: Real-time face detection using webcam and OpenCV.
- **basic.py**: Demonstrates basic image operations like resizing and displaying images.
- **bitwise.py**: Illustrates how to perform bitwise operations on images.
- **blurring.py**: Shows how to apply different types of blurs to an image.
- **colour_spaces.py**: Converts images between different color spaces such as BGR, RGB, and HSV.
- **counters.py**: Detects contours and draws them on images.
- **draw.py**: Demonstrates how to draw basic shapes (like circles, rectangles) on images.
- **eye_detect.py**: Detects eyes in images using Haar Cascades.
- **face_detect.py**: Basic face detection using pre-trained Haar Cascades.
- **gradients.py**: Demonstrates gradient operations (Sobel, Laplacian) for edge detection.
- **haar_face.xml, haarcascade_eye.xml, haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml, haarcascade_smile.xml**: Pre-trained Haar Cascades for face, eye, and smile detection.
- **histogram.py**: Applies histogram equalization for improving image contrast.
- **masking.py**: Masks parts of an image to focus on specific regions.
- **read.py**: Basic script to read, display, and save images using OpenCV.
- **rescale.py**: Resizes images to different scales.
- **smile_detect.py**: Detects smiles in an image using Haar Cascades.
- **splitmerge.py**: Splits an image into its individual channels and merges them back.
- **thresh.py**: Demonstrates thresholding techniques (binary, adaptive, etc.).
- **transformation.py**: Shows how to rotate, translate, and apply affine transformations to images.

## Learning Resources
Here are some helpful resources I used while learning OpenCV:

- [OpenCV Official Documentation](https://docs.opencv.org)
- [OpenCV Python Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o&t=10368s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
- [OpenCV on GitHub](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
- [Real Python - OpenCV Guide](https://realpython.com/)

Feel free to explore these resources as you go through the code.
